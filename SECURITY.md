# Security policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report security issues through
[GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/kaisers-io/refs/security/advisories/new).
That keeps the report private until a fix is available, and it does not require an email
exchange.

**Please do not open a public issue for a security problem.**

You can expect an initial response within a week. If a report is confirmed, the fix ships in a
patch release and the advisory is published once users have had a chance to upgrade. Reporters are
credited unless they ask not to be.

## Supported versions

Only the latest released version receives security fixes. `refs` is pre-1.0 and moves quickly;
there are no long-term support branches.

## What is in scope

- Command injection or argument injection through ref names, URLs, tags, or configuration values.
- Leaking credentials embedded in git URLs into error messages, logs, `--json` output or the
  config file. This has been a real bug class here before and is covered by dedicated regression
  tests.
- Path traversal out of `REFS_HOME` when resolving refs, packages, or checkout paths.
- Anything that causes `refs` to execute code from a checked-out reference repository. `refs` runs
  git commands against checkouts; it must never run *their* code. Each checkout's `core.hooksPath`
  points at the refs-owned hooks directory, so hooks living inside a checkout never run. A way to
  defeat that is in scope.
- Supply-chain problems in the published `@kaisers-io/refs` package: an unexpected bundled
  dependency, a lifecycle script, or a mismatch between the published artifact and this
  repository.

## What is not in scope

**Read-only is a workflow promise, not a security boundary.** This is stated in the README and
matters for triage: every checkout under `sources/` is a managed reference that agents are
instructed not to modify, and `refs` installs git hooks that reject commits and pushes inside one.
Those hooks are a backstop against mistakes, not a sandbox. Reports that a sufficiently determined
local process can still write into a checkout, by removing the hooks, using `--no-verify` or
editing files directly, describe documented behavior rather than a vulnerability.

Similarly out of scope:

- Vulnerabilities in the dependency source code that `refs` checks out. Report those upstream.
- Anything that requires an attacker to already control the machine `refs` runs on.
- Findings from automated scanners without a demonstrated impact on `refs`.

## Untrusted checkout content

`refs` exists to put third-party source code in front of an agent, so a checkout is
attacker-controlled input by construction: its README, comments, and commit messages were written by
whoever owns that repository, and nobody vetted them on the way in. The bundled skill states this as
an explicit trust boundary (`skills/refs/SKILL.md` §4) and carries it into every worker prompt —
checkout content is evidence to read, never instruction to follow, and anything that tries to
redirect the agent is reported to the user instead of acted on.

That is an instruction-level mitigation, not a sandbox. Indirect prompt injection through a tracked
dependency is a real residual risk and prose in a skill does not remove it. What is enforced in code
is narrower: `refs` never runs a checkout's own code (the `core.hooksPath` note above), and it never
reads checkout content as configuration.

Automated skill scanners flag this shape, and one class of finding will keep coming back: Snyk Agent
Scan's `W011`, *exposure to untrusted third-party content*. When it fires, it is right — that is a
description of the feature, not a defect report, and the answer is the guard above rather than not
fetching repositories.

`.github/workflows/skill-audit.yml` runs that scanner on every pull request touching the skill, and
waives nothing. The scanner offers an `--ignore-issues-codes`; we do not use it, because the skill
is clean without one and a standing waiver would hide the real finding it was written for. Its
judges are LLM-based and not deterministic, so treat a single red run as a prompt to re-run and
reproduce locally (`pnpm skill:audit`), not as a verdict — and never edit the skill into something
untrue to make one go away.
